## Contents
- [Hotel Revenue](hotel-revenue): A simple Power-BI dashboard to address a hypothetical business question and show how we can provide insights and recommendations to upgrade a current business model using simple analytics.
- [Sales Dashboard](salesDashboard): Using Superstore retail sales data, this project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can be used to uncover actionable insights and provide recommendations to upgrade a company’s sales strategy using accessible, real-world data.
- [Sentiment Analyzer](sentimentAnalyzer) : This project explores customer review sentiment using natural language processing (NLP). By scraping product reviews and applying TextBlob for sentiment classification, the goal was to uncover patterns in customer feedback and translate them into actionable insights.
- [Survival Formula](moneyTalks) : An econometric analysis of Premier League performance (2014–2025) using R to test wage efficiency, manager tenure and manager stability. By employing OLS regression with Fixed Effects and Nested F-Tests, the study disproves the 'spending guarantees success' hypothesis, revealing that structural club identity is a significantly stronger predictor of points than marginal wage expenditure.
