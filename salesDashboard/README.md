## 🔍 Insights & Recommendations
**Insights:**

- **Office Supplies lead in total sales share**, making up the largest portion in the pie chart visualization. This is a key category driving revenue, outperforming both Technology and Furniture segments. Despite being lower-priced, the volume of Office Supplies sold is consistently higher.

- The **line chart visualizing YOY revenue** shows a significant **spike in sales during Q4**, particularly in November, suggesting strong seasonality. Compared to the previous year, there is a **YOY growth of approximately 15.3%**, with a notable increase in both order volume and customer count.

- The **Total Customers metric increased**, but not as dramatically as revenue, which implies a **higher average order value** or better bundling/upselling performance.

- The **map visual** reveals that the **Western and Central U.S. regions outperform others in terms of total sales**, while some Southern states show underperformance despite having a wide customer base. This could indicate inefficiencies in regional sales strategies or shipping/logistics barriers.

- Additionally, Technology products—although fewer in transaction count—show **higher average sales per order**, hinting at a possible premium segment that can be tapped more aggressively.

**Recommendations:**

- **Capitalize on seasonality**: Increase Q4 marketing efforts, flash sales, and bundled promotions around late October to December to exploit proven shopping behavior.

- **Double down on Office Supplies**: Given their high sales volume, explore expanding this category or offering business subscription models for recurring buyers.

- **Investigate regional sales strategies**: Target underperforming Southern states with localized promotions or better fulfillment options to reduce potential delivery friction.

- **Track customer LTV**: Since average order value appears to be increasing, invest in identifying high-value customers and create personalized campaigns to retain and grow them.
